# PALScan service for cultural heritage protection   


# Motivation
A service used to protect cultural heritage through scan and upload valuable media to a cloud server !

> What is the problem domain ?

Our Problem domain is Archiving and Crowdsourcing data collecting

>What is the specific SOA-based solution ?

IT-motivated solution for cultural protection that enables people themselves to document and preserve cultural documents, photos, audio, etc â€¦

>Why use service computing?
 
Cheaper solution,because the already used tools in the archiving process is very expensive. Reusability because we will use it in our grad project, and Availability.

#### Explaination in detail:

We have Composite Service Called : Palscan Service  

We use Different Atomic services which are : Google places , scan service , filter service, Google cloud datastore  

And the 3rd party services we use are :Google places,Google cloud datastore

# Implementation Details
We impelemented our services using the RESTful service development paradigm. Which is based on the HTTP protocol which is an RPC-based synchronous communication protocol.And our Data representation is JSON.

## Composite Service Algorithm According to BPMN 2.0
## Applied Technologies

development environment: eclipse  <br/>
programming languages : java (JDK 8)<br/>
frameworks and libraries : swagger 2.0, Spring boot<br/>
deployment platforms (PaaS): Google App Engine (GAE), which is a Google Cloud Platform(GCP) service provided by Google<br/>
